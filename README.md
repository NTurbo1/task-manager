# Task Manager API
This repository contains the backend API for the Task Manager application. 
The API is built with Java 17, Spring Boot 3 and follows a microservices architecture. 
It provides functionalities for managing tasks, users, authentication/authorization, 
notification service, project management, and more. The project uses Spring Cloud's 
services for common microservice servers like gateway, discovery server, config server, 
and so on.

This is a pet project of mine created for learning purposes, and it's currently under 
development.

I have also built a [web front-end app](https://github.com/NTurbo1/task-manager-front) 
using Typescript and React for this api.

## Features
- **User management**: User data CRUD and profile management.

- **Task management:** Task data CRUD.

- **API Gateway:** Serves as a single entry point for all the microservices, 
    handles centralized routing, authentication/authorization, and load balancing.

- **Service discovery:** Maintains a registry of available microservices 
    and their instances.

- **Config server:** Stores application configuration files.

## Overall tech Stack:
- **Java 17**: Core programming language 
- **Spring Boot (v3.3.3):** Backend framework for building microservices.
- **Spring Cloud Gateway:** API Gateway for routing and filtering requests.
- **Spring Cloud Config**: Central configurations storage server.
- **Spring Cloud Netflix Eureka:** Service discovery and registration. 
- **Spring Data (Jpa, MongoDB, Redis)**: Database interactions. 
- **Spring Web:** Rest API, MVC, framework for building web apps.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing user and task data.
- **Redis**: NoSQL database for storing user login session.
- **Mongock:** Database migration tool for MongoDB.
- **RabbitMQ:** Message Queue (async communication between the microservices).
- **Docker:** Containerization for deployment and local development.
- **Testing:** JUnit 5, Mockito

## Microservices
- **API Gateway:** Routes requests to the respective microservices and manages authentication/authorization.
- **Service Discovery:** Dynamically discovers and registers services.
- **Config server:** Stores all the main configuration files.
- **User Service:** Manages user-related operations like registration, profiles, and password management.
- **Task Service:** Handles task-related operations like creating, updating, and deleting tasks.

## Prerequisites
- Java 17
- Maven
- Docker & Docker Compose

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally.

### 1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/NTurbo1/task-manager.git
cd task-manager
```

### 2. Set up Docker containers
Start the required services (MongoDB, Redis, etc.) with Docker Compose.
```
docker-compose up -d
```

### 3. Configure environment variables
TODO: Should be updated...

### 4. Build and run the services
Build the individual microservices and start them.
```
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 5. Access the API
The services can be accessed via the API Gateway, typically running on
```http://localhost:8222```

## Docker Setup
A docker-compose.yml file is provided for local development. It sets up 
the following services:

- MongoDB
- Redis
- RabbitMQ

To start all services with Docker, use ```docker-compose up```.

## API Documentation
This project uses Swagger/OpenAPI tools for api documentation. 
After starting all the services, you can access the swagger ui on 
```http://localhost:8222/swagger-ui.html```.
